### Welcome ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nikolaos Anastasopoulos and I work as a fullstack developer.
I recently finished working on a music distribution application with Horus Music, built wih PHP and the Symfony framework. 
I am currently taking courses on Fullstack JavaScript Development (Node.js + React.js) and Amazon Web Services,
while looking for an exciting new project to tackle. 
I focus on writing quality-code that solves complex business problems and improves the user experience. 

Professional Projects:
* [Horus Music - My Client Zone Web Application](https://www.mmaz.myclientzone.com)
* [Hope Within Ministries - Mobile Application](https://www.play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hopewithinministries.hopewithin)
